## My name is Saleck, you probably didn't heard about me
### Hello there!
My name is Saleck and I'm a PHP developer from Argentina.

This are my personal Github repositories and while I do have some "usefull" projects most of what you'll find here is from my studies, both old school proyects or different courses that I have done. I'm looking forward to making some useful projects to add, new ideas are always welcome!

On that note, you'll see that a lot of what I have made is in Java or Javascript, thats because I work with PHP but in the university we used mostly Java, do contact and offer me jobs about both! (also .NET if you feel like it)
